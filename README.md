# Spelling bee solver

Just a quick little python script to get words that solve the daily spelling bee game from New York Times.

The word list comes from `/usr/share/dict/words` (`words` package in Arch). This list is probably incomplete, since it does not contain all the words necessary to get a perfect score, but it is usually sufficient to at least get to the final tier (genius).

## How to use

Just change the two first variables to the letters in the game.
